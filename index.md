State-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms predominantly learn a policy either from a numerical state vector or from images. Both approaches generally do not take structural knowledge of the task into account. This is especially prevalent in robotic applications and can benefit learning if exploited. This work introduces a neural network architecture that combines relational inductive bias and visual feedback to learn an efficient position control policy for robotic manipulation. We derive a graph representation that models the physical structure of the manipulator and combines the robot's internal state with a low-dimensional description of the visual scene generated by an image encoding network. On this basis, a graph neural network trained with reinforcement learning predicts joint velocities to control the robot. We further introduce an asymmetric approach to train the image encoder separately from the policy using supervised learning. Experimental results demonstrate that, for a 2-DoF planar robot in a geometrically simplistic 2D environment, a learned representation of the visual scene can replace access to the explicit coordinates of the reaching target without compromising on the quality and sample efficiency of the policy. We further show the ability of the model to improve sample efficiency for a 6-DoF robot arm in a visually realistic 3D environment.

### Contributions
We identify a blind spot in the reinforcement learning research as, to our knowledge, there exists no method for inducing a relational bias into a vision-based reinforcement learning system. For this reason, we explore and present a graph neural network model that integrates structural knowledge with image observations and apply it to learn an efficient position control policy for robotic manipulation using reinforcement learning.

To this end, we make the following contributions:
* We introduce a new architecture that combines an image encoding network with a lightweight graph network to learn an efficient control policy.
* We show that the relational inductive bias introduced by applying a graph neural network to the graph representation of the robot's state can reduce the sample complexity when training RL agents for robot control without compromising quality.
* We present a method to iteratively train an image encoding network for image representation learning based on optimizing an auxiliary loss from data generated by the policy.
